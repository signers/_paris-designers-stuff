<p>If you have page-specific styles, it is better to put them in a <code>pages/</code> folder, in a file named after the page. For instance, it’s not uncommon to have very specific styles for the home page hence the need for a <code>_home.scss</code> file in <code>pages/</code>.</p>

<p><em>Note — Depending on your deployment process, these files could be called on their own to avoid merging them with the others in the resulting stylesheet. It is really up to you.</em></p>
